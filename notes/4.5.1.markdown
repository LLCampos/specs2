Maintenance version, with a change in the internal API which should not impact regular users.
The important fix is the one about the reported times which should be a lot more correct now.

## Fixes

 * #731 make sure that times are reported consistently (this changes the internal API for `Expectation`)
 * #728 use a simple Await to timeout examples
 * fixed a comment on `SimpleTimer` and added a return type
